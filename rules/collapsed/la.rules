## CONSONANTS
####


##
# Voiceless plosives
##

# labio-velar, TODO actually k^w /kw/
{qu,qv} -> kw

# some uncertainty about forms like quum exist (might be like /kum/)
# but the above also accepted
# always a velar plosive before the fifth century
c -> k

t -> t

# The letter K was in early Latin regularly used for /k/ before /a/ 
# but in classical times had been replaced by C except in a very small 
# number of words.
k -> k


##
# Voiced plosives
##

# by graphic parallelism with qu:  TODO: actually g^w
/{gu,gv}/$vow -> gw
# Some nasalizations rules
#/ng/n -> ŋ   # congnatus pronunced /koŋnatus/
#/g/n -> ŋ

g -> g

##
# Aspirates
##

# mostly from greek loan words
# Latin had no aspirated consonants and so these digraphs tended to be 
# pronounced like P (and later F), T, and K
ph -> p
ch -> k
th -> t

##
# Nasals
##

n -> n


# this is not the full story, 
# It is likely that, by the Classical period, /m/ at the end of words was 
# pronounced weakly, either voiceless or simply by nasalizing (and lengthening) 
# the preceding vowel. For instance decem ("ten") was probably pronounced 
# [ˈdekẽː]. In addition to the metrical features of Latin poetry, the fact that 
# all such endings lost the final M in the descendant Romance languages 
# strengthens this hypothesis. For simplicity, and because this is not 
# known for certain, M is just treated as the consonant /m/ here and in 
# other references.
m -> m
