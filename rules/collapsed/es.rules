# H: Silent, unless combined with c (see above). Hu- or hi- followed by another
# vowel at the start of the word stand for /w/ (English w) and /j/ (English y).
# Also used in foreign words like hámster, where it is pronounced like a
# Spanish j (see below).
_/{hi,hu}/$vow -> w
$i -> i

j -> x

ll -> ʎ
ñ	-> ɲ

$o -> o

# Q: Like q in quit. As in English, it is always followed by a u, but before e
# or i, the u is silent (líquido is pronounced /'li.ki.δo/). The English /kw/
# sound is normally written cu in Spanish (cuanto), although qu can be used for
# this sound in front of a or o (quásar, quórum).
/qu/$ei -> k
q -> k
/qu/[aáoó] -> kw

# R: This has two pronunciations, neither of which exist in English. The 'soft'
# pronunciation sounds like American relaxed pronunciation of tt in "butter",
# and is written r (always written r). The 'hard' pronunciation is a multiply
# vibrating sound, similar to Scottish rolled r (generally written rr). 'Hard'
# r is also the sound of r at the start of a word or after l, n or s.
rr -> r
r -> ɾ # Includes the trills after [_nlrs]

/u/$vow -> w
v -> b
w -> b # u?
x -> ks

# Y: Technically, it is simply the preferred spelling of i + vowel at the
# beginning of a word or vowel + i at the end of a word (yeso rather than ieso,
# hay rather than hai), and should be pronounced exactly as i. However, in some
# places it is identical to English y. In Argentina is pronounced similar to
# the English sh in she, or English j in jump, and in Chile is pronounced /ʒ/
# (like English si in vision).
y	-> ʝ # voiced palatal fricative   "y" (yo, yerro, yerba)

# Z: Always the same sound as a soft c i.e. either /θ/ (most of Spain) or /s/
# (elsewhere). See c for details.
